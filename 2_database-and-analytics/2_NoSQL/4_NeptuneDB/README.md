# AWS Machine Learning

## Notes
- IMPORTANT note about NeptuneDB.  If you create an instance from the AWS Console, you can NOT delete it, because, by default, termination protection is enabled.  You must use the `aws cli` tool to disable temination protection for your instance, then you can delete it.
