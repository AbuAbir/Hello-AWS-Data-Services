# Sample Datasets 

I've included a couple of sample datasets in this folder.  Also, some samples are in the folder with the scripts for the AWS service, i.e. RDS sample data in the `database-and-analytics` folder.

Additionally, several of my other learning GitHub Repos include sample data sets.
These include the following:
- Sample data in `Learning Hadoop-and-Spark` - [link](https://github.com/lynnlangit/learning-hadoop-and-spark/tree/master/0b-Example-Datasets)
- Sample data in `gcp-for-bioinformatics` - [link](https://github.com/lynnlangit/gcp-for-bioinformatics/tree/master/1_Files_%26_Data/genomic-data-samples)
- Sample data in `gcp-essentials` - [link](https://github.com/lynnlangit/gcp-essentials/tree/master/7_sample_data)
