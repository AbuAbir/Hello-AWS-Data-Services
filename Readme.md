## AWS Data Services

This is a set of scripts and instructions designed to help you quickly set up and load key AWS data services for demo and learning purposes.  The goal is to get a 'Hello World' implementation set up quickly. These samples use the Navicat client (14-day free trial) for RDS and Redshift.  I recommend using the now-available Jupyter Notebook to quickly connect to EMR.  Samples include the following AWS Data Services:  
  - AWS RDS Aurora and MySQL
  - AWS Redshift and Redshift Spectrum
  - AWS EMR with Spark
  - AWS Athena
  - AWS DynamoDB
  - AWS Kinesis, including Kinesis Analytics
 
Includes simple scripts as follows:
   - awscli scripts 
   - AWS SDK node.js scripts 
  
## AWS Machine Learning 

Includes information about using machine learning servers and services, including the following:  
  - AWS Machine Learning AMI for EC2
  - AWS SageMaker
  - MxNet on Databricks using AWS
  - AWS EMR with Spark ML

NOTES on the examples:
   - All are set to run in the 'us-east-1' AWS region.
   - All were prepared on an OSX laptop.
   - Machine Learning 'Hello World' example is 'mnist' (the 10 handwritten digits)
